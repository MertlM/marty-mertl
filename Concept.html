            <p>When I started to work on the webpage for my projects, 
                I had no clue how it would like, just the projects that I wanted to involve.
                My first idea was a cork board design. The text and the pictures would have been on sticky notes placed on the board.</p>
                <p>While searching webpages for more inspiration, I got an idea that became the final design. 
            The design is based on the classic blueprints, seen among others in the TV show Mythbusters.
            I tried to stick to the design during the coding process. 
            I managed to find this simple, but cool wallpaper matching my ideas and I used Permanent Marker font type by Google Fonts.</p>
