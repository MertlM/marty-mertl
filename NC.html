            <p>In 2019 I participated in the World Robot Olympiad with two friends. Our team was called New Crew.</p>
            <p>WRO is a global Lego robot competition, where elementary schoolers and high schoolers can compete in various categories, 
            such as: robot football, open category (the competitors are given a kind of project task, which they need to present), ARC(Advanced Robotics Challenge for university students) 
            and regular category(this category is divided into 4 age groups: WeDo for nursery schoolers, Elementary for elementary schoolers, Junior for middle schoolers and Senior for high schoolers).</p> 
            <p>New Crew entered in Regular Senior. We were given a challenge in advance and had to design a robot construction and write a code used by the robot while driving autonomously on the field given by the organisers.
            We managed to qualify to the national final from the regional, but unfortunately took <br>the 15 th place out of 20, and we did not go on to participate in the global final, which was organised in Győr.</p>
