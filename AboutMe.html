            <p>I am Martin Mertl, a mechanical engineering student at the Budapest University of Science and Economics. I am in my second semester.</p>
            <p>I consider myself to be friendly creative and open-minded. I can easily get enthusiastic in any topic. I am a good team player.</p>
            <p>I had attended Ady Endre High School in Ráckeve, where I was born, and finished in 2020.
            In my high school years I would work as a tutor in Dunaharaszti. I would teach elementary schoolers programming in some graphical languages and LEGO EV3 robots.
            Nowadays, I have been learning bicycle repairing in a local bike shop in Ráckeve.</p>
